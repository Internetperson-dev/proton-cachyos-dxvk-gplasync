Introduction
------------

**Proton** is a tool for use with the Steam client which allows games which are
exclusive to Windows to run on the Linux operating system. It uses Wine to
facilitate this.

**Proton-CachyOS** is a tool for use with the Steam client and
[umu-launcher][umu-launcher] which builds on Proton introducing experimental
features, third-party tools and more. You can find binary packages for use
with Steam Linux Runtime in this repository's [releases][releases].

**Most users should use Proton provided by the Steam Client itself.** See
[this Steam Community post][steam-play-introduction] for more details. This
custom Proton distributions is provided for users who want to test bleeding-edge
features, community modifications and stores other than Steam.

**The changelog** is available in [CHANGELOG.md][changelog-md].

**Build instructions** are available in [BUILDING.md][building-md].

Runtime Config Options
----------------------

Proton can be tuned at runtime to help certain games run. The Steam client sets
some options for known games using the `STEAM_COMPAT_CONFIG` variable.
You can override these options using the environment variables described below.

The best way to set these environment overrides for all games is by renaming
`user_settings.sample.py` to `user_settings.py` and modifying it appropriately.
This file is located in the Proton installation directory in your Steam library
(often `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Proton #.#`).

If you want to change the runtime configuration for a specific game, you can
use the `Set Launch Options` setting in the game's `Properties` dialog in the
Steam client. Set the variable, followed by `%command%`. For example, input
"`PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 %command%`" to use the OpenGL-based wined3d renderer
instead of the Vulkan-based DXVK renderer.

To enable an option, set the variable to a non-`0` value. To disable an
option, set the variable to `0`. To use Steam's default configuration, do
not specify the variable at all.

All of the below are runtime options. They do not effect permanent changes to
the Wine prefix. Removing the option will revert to the previous behavior.

| `noopwr`             | `WINE_DISABLE_VULKAN_OPWR`               | Enable hack to disable Vulkan other process window rendering which sometimes causes issues on Wayland due to blit being one frame behind.                                                                              |
| `hidenvgpu`          | `PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU`                 | Force Nvidia GPUs to always be reported as AMD GPUs. Some games require this if they depend on Windows-only Nvidia driver functionality. See also DXVK's nvapiHack config, which only affects reporting from Direct3D. |
|                      | `WINE_FULLSCREEN_INTEGER_SCALING`        | Enable integer scaling mode, to give sharp pixels when upscaling.                                                                                                                                                      |

| `dxvksarek`          | `PROTON_DXVK_SAREK`            | Use the [dxvk-sarek](https://github.com/pythonlover02/DXVK-Sarek) fork as DXVK replacement for older GPUs that don't properly support Vulkan 1.3 (supported Vulkan 1.1.x to 1.2.x). It is using the `async` branch, so it **SHOULD NOT** to be used with games using anti-cheat or multiplayer games in general. You have been warned.                                                                                                                                             |
| `dxvklowlatency`     | `PROTON_DXVK_LOWLATENCY`       | Enable the alternative [dxvk-low-latency](https://github.com/netborg-afps/dxvk-low-latency) fork, which enhances the original dxvk with low-latency frame pacing capabilities to improve game responsiveness and input lag. It also improves latency stability over time, usually resulting in a more accurate playback speed of the generated video.

|                      | `WINEALSA_CHANNELS`  | Allows to select more than two channels with the winealsa driver as well as force disable spatial audio in games. Can be useful with surround setups or when the sounds come out wrong positionally (like dialogue coming out only from the left speaker). Possible values is the number of speakers, such as `2` (to disable spatial audio), such as `4` (2 front, 2 rear), `6` (5.1) or `8` (7.1). |
|                      | `WINEALSA_SPATIAL`   | Properly downmixes spatial with `winealsa` and includes the height channels. Use `1` to enable, `0` to disable (default).

### Proton wayland quirks

If something that uses Electron/CEF (launchers like Battle.net, Ubisoft Connect, EA App, Rockstar Launcher) doesn't
work (displays as white window) after enabling native Wayland support, try adding `--in-process-gpu` to the command
arguments. If you encounter controller issues with `winewayland.drv`, try using `PROTON_USE_SDL=1`, or running Steam
with `-steamos3` which might allow Steam Input to work. For other options relating to `winewayland.drv` refer
to [Proton-EM documentation](https://github.com/Etaash-mathamsetty/Proton/blob/em-10/docs/EM-ADDITIONS.md)

**NOTE:** The automated wayland hacks that were included in Proton 10 have been removed on purpose pending a proper
implementation. This is the reason previous versions seemed to work but in Proton 11 some launchers display as a white
window.


### Pipewire audio driver
* The driver is enabled by default. To disable it and use `winepulse.drv` set `PROTON_USE_PIPEWIRE=0`.
* You can also use `WINE_AUDIO_DRIVER` to set the list of audio drivers for wine to choose from. The default list
  is `pipewire,pulse,alsa`. For example `WINE_AUDIO_DRIVER=pulse` will use `winepulse.drv` exclusively.
* When reporting issues with `winepipewire.drv` remember to use `PROTON_LOG=warn+pipewire,warn+mmdevapi %command%`
  to create meaningful logs. Make sure to leep the logging level at `warn+` as shown.
  Full tracing (`+pipewire,+mmdevapi`) floods the log and perturbs audio timing enough to cause crackling,
  so only use it for a short capture and remove it for normal play.
* **Lower latency** (system-wide; smaller = lower latency, more CPU; `0` = auto)
    ```
    pw-metadata -n settings 0 clock.force-quantum 256
    ```
  To make it permanent edit `~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/99-lowlatency.conf`:
    ```
    context.properties = { default.clock.min-quantum = 256 }
    ```
  Setting `PIPEWIRE_LATENCY` does nothing here, use the quantum above.
* **Choose output device** - games follow your PipeWire default sink. Change it in
  your sound settings, `pavucontrol` (Playback tab), or `wpctl set-default <id>`.
  The game shows up named after itself or as `winepipewire`.
* You can make sure the game uses `winepipewire.drv` either through `pw-top` or by looking at the audio device
  names in the game itself which should include `(Pipewire)` in their name.         



### Optiscaler integration

* Other than `PROTON_USE_OPTISCALER=1` to enable it, you might need to use `PROTON_OPTISCALER_NAME=<name.dll>` to
  control the DLL that should be injected. Three names are supported for `PROTON_OPTISCALER_NAME`, `dxgi.dll`,
  `d3d12.dll` and `dbghelp.dll` and defaults to `dxgi.dll` unless explictly set.
* You can use `PROTON_OPTISCALER_CONFIG` write arbitrary configuration in `OptiScaler.ini`. The config is a semicolon (
  `;`) separated string of individual options. The template for each option is `{section}.{option}={value}`, for example
  `PROTON_OPTISCALER_CONFIG="Upscalers.Dx11Upscaler=fsr31;Upscalers.Dx12Upscaler=dlss"`. To avoid mistakes, only config
  options that already exist in `Optiscaler.ini` can be modified.
* The changes to the config are permanent until OptiScaler is upgraded or downgraded to a different version. To modify a
  setting it has to either be manually edited or altered by applying a different config through the environment
  variable. Be careful, using this will also remove any comments from the `OptiScaler.ini` file. Keep a backup or refer
  to [the repo](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/blob/master/OptiScaler.ini) for documentation of the various
  settings.
* When enabled, the `PROTON_<UPSCALER>_UPGRADE` options can be used to dictate the versions of the upscaler DLLs to
  download and use, so `PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE=4.0.2` will download the FidelityFX DLLs for version `4.0.2`.
* The configuration files are placed with the DLLs in `<prefix>/drive_c/windows/system32/umu/` in case you need to edit
  them. Further configuration options exposed through environment variables are not planned, and likely to not be
  implemented.
* Right now drop-in DLL replacements are not possible, since the files are validated on each startup. If you need more
  fine-grained control than what is offered by the in-game menu, it's probably better to manually set up OptiScaler.
* I consider this work-in-progress, and it will certainly not work with all games. **Do not report issues to OptiScaler
  when using this, always try their own manual installation first (and of course disable this feature when doing so).**
